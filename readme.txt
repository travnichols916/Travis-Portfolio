# Travis' Portfolio

## Description

 A coding portfolio is as essential to the job search process as a professional resume. Many employers expect coding portfolios from candidates and may actively search for them during the hiring process. I expect to utilize this project as an opportunity to gain meaningful relationships with future employers but also expand my horizons on available options in my career by showcasing my talents.
Coding employers want to see current work in a coding portfolio. The process not only showed me the fundamentals to a coding resume but also helped me implement advanced CSS skills inclduding use of media queries, CSS selectors and use of flexbox for a responsive design.

## Installation

Basic logistics of my webpage design started with the use of Microsoft Paint to get the framing built. 


HTML


Next I started making an HTML utilizing Header and the NAV bar to create the top section of my webpage by including about me, work, and contact me with corresponding links. I used CSS selector #.

I then set up a section with a photo of myself and wrote Fullstack Developer.

The about me included section id tags and had a flex-row tag for its division.

"My name is Travis, I live in Sacramento. I am a pickleball player and I love to go to the gym. 
I recently started at UC berkely Extension Fullstack Development bootcamp. Since starting I have learned valuable skills in programming from learning HTML, CSS and I am starting to learn more about Javascript. 
My hopes are to develop websites to help convert visitors into customers and help your business grow. Given are some links to my projects."

		
The next section was the work section which showed my work from the previous challenge including an image of the webpage. A figcaption was used as a caption for the image.


The final section on the html was a contact me section which looked at the listed elements including my phone number, my email and github.




CSS section
This section began with adding a border on the contents of the header as well as a max height.


Next a root for the primary color #2a6b50(foresty green) was applied throughout the style css page. next were the selectors * to include no margin, padding and a border-box for the sizing.

The body section include #1c8591 as the blue for color and a font-family of Helvetica, arial and sans-serif.


Styles to the header included 20 px padding and 35 px padding which means the top and bottom padding is 20 pixels and the left and right padding is 35 pixels.

header h1 included a font-weight of bold with a font size of 36 pixels.
Many more adjustments were made but to make this readme bring more focus to the skills utilized from the module, instructor and tutor I will address the sections where a more advanced css coding was implemented.

Background image was linked by using background-image:url(JPG FILE NAME)
display was on flex, and justified-content was information that was found using the flexbox frogger game that was played. 
Variance of primary color was a skill that was used for multiple areas throughout the coding.



Borders and captions included their own seperate coding. Hopefully this doesn't overcomplicate the file.






## Usage


Screenshots were provided of the Html coding for the Navigation elements and another for the CSS coding use of flexbox properties.
